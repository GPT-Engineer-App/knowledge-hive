 Knowledge Sharing Website Requirements 

**Purpose:**
To create an AI-assisted platform for knowledge sharing that simplifies the process of acquiring and disseminating knowledge, supporting the creation and management of both public and private knowledge bases.

**Core Features:**

2. **Expert Resources:**
   - Integrate AI experts and human experts to provide professional answers and in-depth analysis.

3. **Q&A System:**
   - Implement a real-time Q&A feature to quickly connect users with experts.

4. **Knowledge Creation and Sharing:**
   - Users can upload documents, and AI assists in integrating them into the knowledge base, with support for multi-language translation.

5. **Community Interaction:**
   - Allows users to interact through sharing, commenting, and liking.

6. **Advanced Search:**
   - Provides search functionality to help users quickly find the knowledge they need.

7. **Personalized Learning Recommendations:**
   - Recommends personalized content based on user behavior.

8. **Copyright and Citation Standards:**
   - Ensures content complies with copyright laws and proper citations are made.

**Simplified Access Control:**
- Owners of private knowledge bases can invite editors and set access permissions.

By streamlining, the knowledge sharing website will offer a clear and efficient environment for knowledge management and sharing, while maintaining necessary community interaction and personalized learning experiences.
